## Environment
With `conda`, create and activate the environment with the following commands:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate iapr_project
```

Otherwise, you can use `pip` directly:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Folder structure
```
📁 src/                     # Put here all auxiliary scripts needed by main.py
📄 check.py                 # Script for checking the validity and reproducibility of the submission
📄 environment.yml          # Configuration file for creating the conda environment
📄 main.py                  # The executable script that produces the Kaggle submission file
📄 report.ipynb             # The report file for you to fill
📄 requirements.txt         # File containing the list and versions of allowed libraries
📄 sample_submission.csv    # Example of valid submission file
```

### `main.py`

The `main.py` script must be runnable with the environment specified by `environment.yml`/`requirements.txt` and it must generate the submission file with name `submission.csv`.

### `check.py`

Script provided by the ❤️ TAs ❤️, useful to check the validity and reproducibility of the submission.

```
usage: check.py [-h] {check,match} ...

positional arguments:
  {check,match}
    check        checks whether the submission file is valid
    match        checks whether two submission files match

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
```

#### Checking the validity of a submission file

```
usage: check.py check [-h] [--path PATH]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --path PATH  path of submission file to check (default: 'submission.csv')
```

#### Checking whether two submission files match (e.g. the submission file uploaded on Kaggle and the submission file generated by `main.py`)

```
usage: check.py match [-h] [--local LOCAL] [--kaggle KAGGLE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --local LOCAL    path of local submission file (default: 'submission.csv')
  --kaggle KAGGLE  path of Kaggle submission file (default: 'kaggle.csv')
```

## Submission
Your submission must contain (at least) the following:
```
📁 src/                         # All auxiliary scripts needed by main.py
📄 main.py                      # The executable script that produces the Kaggle submission file
📄 report.ipynb / report.pdf    # The final Jupyter Notebook report (to be submitted as PDF or ipynb)
📄 checkpoint.pt                # (optional) the checkpoint of your model (for the ML challenge)
```
