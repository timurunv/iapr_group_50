    "In this lab, we will be working with histological data. Histological images are created from tissue samples that are digitized using high-resolution scanners. Without preparation, human tissues lack visual contrast and have poor tissue differentiations. To overcome this issue, clinical institutes use chemical staining to artificially enhance contrast. The most famous one is called HE (hematoxylin and eosin) staining. Hematoxylin stains tissue nuclei with a deep purple while eosin focuses more on extracellular matrix components with a pink stain.\n",

    "* **Q1 (3 pts)** In this section we ask you to implement from scratch your own `region_growing` function to detect the tumor area. The function should take as input an RGB image, seeds that are manual initialization points in the tumor area, and the maximum number of iterations to perform. ote that the function also includes the kwargs argument. You can use it to add additional parameters to your function if needed (see [doc kwargs](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/args_and_kwargs.html)). Importantly, for timing reasons, a single explicit for loop on iterations is expected. An explicit for loop on pixels or neighbours will be accepted but penalised by 1 point. Use numpy tools to succeed.\n",
